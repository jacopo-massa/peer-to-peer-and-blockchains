# Pandemic Mobile Flu

## N.B. 
To make the simulation needed for the project, I used an open-source simulator called "The Opportunistic Network Environment" ([THE ONE](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one))
The [wiki page](https://github.com/akeranen/the-one/wiki) has the latest information.

The other important tool used to plot graphs and analyze the simulations' results is [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx), a python library useful to analyze complex networks.
